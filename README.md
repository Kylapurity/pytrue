PyTrue is a small open-source authentication API writen in Python. It is a port of [GoTrue](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue), a similar API service but written in Go. 

It's based on OAuth2 and JWT and will handle user signup, authentication.
How we weer insipred with this application is because we have had situation where most of the third party are an enable to help at a time of emergency  making it unable to login and by our application all they need is a passowrd and user email to access the application. After that a token will be generated for them to use it to login,these really helps by ensuring security and even solution to many OAuth2 needed.
